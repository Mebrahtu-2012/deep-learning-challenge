# Analysis

- **Overview of the analysis**: The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on various features in the dataset. The model aims to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

## Results:

## Data Preprocessing:

- **Target variable(s)**: The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL", indicating whether an organization was successful or not.
- **Feature variable(s)**: The feature variables for the model include all columns except "IS_SUCCESSFUL", "EIN", and "NAME".
- **Variables removed**: The "EIN" and "NAME" columns were removed as they are neither targets nor features.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

- **Neurons, layers, and activation functions**: For the first attempt, the model had three hidden layers with 8, 4, and 2 neurons respectively, using the "tanh" activation function. In the second attempt, only two hidden layers were used with 8 and 4 neurons, also using "tanh" activation. The third attempt used two layers with 10 and 5 neurons, with "tanh" activation for the first and "relu" for the second.
- **Achievement of target model performance**: The target model performance was not achieved in any of the attempts, as the highest accuracy obtained was around 72.5%.
- **Steps taken to increase model performance**: Various attempts were made to improve the model performance, including adjusting the number of neurons and layers, changing activation functions, and training for more epochs. However, none of these attempts resulted in achieving the target accuracy.

# Summary:

Overall, the deep learning models developed did not meet the target predictive accuracy of 75%. Despite multiple optimization attempts, the best accuracy achieved was approximately 72.5%. To improve model performance, further experimentation could be conducted, such as:

- Trying different neural network architectures, including more complex models with additional layers and neurons.
- Experimenting with different activation functions and optimizers.
- Conducting more extensive preprocessing, such as feature engineering or handling imbalanced data.
- Exploring techniques like regularization or dropout to prevent overfitting.

A recommendation for a different model could be to explore ensemble methods, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which often perform well with tabular data and can capture complex relationships between features. These models could be trained and evaluated alongside the deep learning approach to determine the most effective solution for the classification problem.

In addition to the mentioned options, other strategies could include:

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- Implementing techniques like data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data.
- Conducting more extensive feature selection to focus on the most informative features.

By systematically exploring these alternatives and carefully evaluating their performance, it may be possible to develop a model that achieves the desired predictive accuracy.
