# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview:

This repository contains code and documentation for a deep learning model developed to predict the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations based on various features provided in the dataset. The project is structured into four main steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing of the dataset involves identifying target and feature variables, handling rare categorical variables, encoding categorical variables, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and scaling the features.

- **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**: This step involves designing a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras, compiling and training the model, and evaluating its performance using test data to calculate loss and accuracy.

- **Optimizing the Model**: Optimization techniques such as adjusting input data, modifying neural network architecture, and experimenting with activation functions and training parameters are applied to improve the model's predictive accuracy.

- **Report on the Neural Network Model**: A comprehensive report on the performance of the deep learning model is written, including details on data preprocessing, model architecture, achieved performance, attempted optimizations, and recommendations for future improvements
